DISTRIBUTED HASH TABLE
----------------------

DHT is composed of three main components

 - abstract keyspace
 - keyspace partioning
 - overlay network

CODE
----

For now there is only a script ``dht.py`` that can be used to bootstrap
a client into a ``DHT`` network (in this case we use the bittorrent).
